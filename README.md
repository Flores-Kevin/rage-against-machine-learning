# rage-against-machine-learning
Project 4

We will create a music recommendation GUI based off of the spotify API. 
We will use the K-Nearest Neighbor machine learning algorithm to help us do this.
We anticipate taking in user input of a song, and outputting songs that are similar to said input song.
